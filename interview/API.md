### What is REST Architecture?

REST, or REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other
1. Uniform Interface
2. Client- Server
3. **Statelessness** - Statelessness mandates that each request from the client to the server must contain all of the information necessary to understand and complete the request
4. **Cacheability** - requires that a response should implicitly or explicitly label itself as cacheable or non-cacheable.
5. Layered System Architecture
6. Code on Demand

### Which constrains can achieve uniform interface

1. **Identification of resources**
2. **Manipulation of resources through representations**
3. **Self-descriptive messages**
4. **Hypermedia as the engine of application state**

### What is RESTful API / Rest API?

A REST API (also known as a RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API) that conforms to the design principles of the representational state transfer (REST) architectural style

### What is resource in REST?

The key abstraction of information in REST is a resource.The state of the resource, at any particular time, is known as the **resource representation**.

resource representation consists of 
* data
* metadata
* hypermedia links
