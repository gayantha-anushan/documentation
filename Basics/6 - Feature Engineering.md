## Feature Engineering

* determine which features are most important with mutual information
* invent new features in several real world problem
* encode high cardinality categorical with a target encoding
* create a segmentation features with k-means clustering
* decompoe dtabase vvariation into features with principal component analysis

### Goals of feature engineering

* improve model's predictive performance
* reduce computational or data needs
* improve interpretability of result

### Mutual Information

Mutual information is a lot like correlation in that it measures a relationship between two quantities. The advantage of mutual information is that it can detect any kind of relationship, while correlation only detects linear relationships.

* easy to use and interpret
* computationaly efficient
